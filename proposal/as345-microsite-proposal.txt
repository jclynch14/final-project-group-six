One of these aspects that we think is really important is the fact that the Art Museum is free for everyone. We believe that if the public was more aware of this that visitors and donations would increase. Our group is going to track our success through a quantitative path because this gives us lots of easily accessible and accurate data. The method we have chosen to use is Google Analytics. Not only is this a good program, but also one that would be good to learn since it is commonly used in the Ôreal world.Õ To launch our Micro-Site we will be using a combination of Facebook and Twitter since all of our group members have accounts with these sites. We look forward to seeing the results from our Micro-Site with the UK Art Museum.
